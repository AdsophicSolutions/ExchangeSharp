ExchangeSharp is a C# console app and framework for trading and communicating with various exchange API end points for stocks or cryptocurrency assets.

The framework is in early stages but I plan on updating and enhancing it regularly.

Roadmap:
- More exchanges, private end points (orders, etc.).
- Better documentation.

Please send pull requests if you have made a change that you feel is worthwhile.
